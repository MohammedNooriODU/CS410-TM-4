            When traveling or moving into a new location, finding new
            restaurants can be a daunting and indecisive task, especially in an
            unfamiliar location. Traditional restaurant recommendation apps
            present too many choices without the ability to customize options to
            the user{"'"}s preference, making them feel overwhelmed.
            Furthermore, the popularity of fast-food and well-known restaurants
            can easily draw attention away from “mom and pop” and “hole in the
            wall” restaurants. Finding a place to eat has the potential to take
            and waste a lot of time searching through lists of restaurants and
            the possibility of missing out on a unique food experience.
